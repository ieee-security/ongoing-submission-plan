# Proposed VLDB-like Process for S&P

This GitHub repo aims to be a public forum for crafting, documenting, and detailed planning of a VLDB-like ongoing submission model for IEEE Security &amp; Privacy (aka Oakland).  If the plan crafted here is approved at the 2017 business meeting, the new process will become effective for Oakland'18.

This repo can be used as any other OSS code repository, and you can fork, edit, and submit pull requests as you wish, to change the text of the proposed plan.

However, we encourage the use of the GitHub *issues* feature to allow for threaded discussion of proposed changes.  As a general rule, changes to the mainline draft plan without a corresponding discussion in the issues won't be accepted.

## Proposed plan for an ongoing-submission model:
* **[Philosophy and Motivation](motivation.md)**
* **[Roles in Program Committee](pc-roles.md)**
* **[Steady-state Process](steady-state-submission-process.md)**
* **[Transition Process](transition-process.md)**
* **[Observations](benefits-and-observations.md)**
* **[F.A.Q.](FAQ.md)**
