  "body": "# Proposed VLDB-like Process for S&P\r\n\r\nThis GitHub repository aims to be a public forum for the crafting, documenting, and detailed planning of a VLDB-like ongoing submission model for IEEE Security &amp; Privacy (a.k.a. Oakland).  If the plan crafted here is approved at the May 2017 business meeting, the new process will become effective for Oakland'18.\r\n\r\nThis repository can be used as with any other OSS code repository; i.e, you can fork, edit, and submit pull requests as you wish, to change the text of the proposed plan.\r\n\r\nHowever, we encourage the use of the GitHub *issues* feature to allow for threaded discussion of proposed changes.  As a general rule, changes to the mainline draft plan without a corresponding discussion in the issues won't be accepted.  Discussions within a pull request will be focused on minor tweaks and improvements.\r\n\r\n## Proposed plan for an ongoing-submission model:\r\n* **[Philosophy and Motivation](motivation.md)**\r\n* **[Roles in Program Committee](pc-roles.md)**\r\n* **[Steady-state Process](steady-state-submission-process.md)**\r\n* **[Transition Process](transition-process.md)**\r\n* **[Observations](benefits-and-observations.md)**\r\n* **[F.A.Q.](FAQ.md)**\r\n",
