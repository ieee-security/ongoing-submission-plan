# Steady-State Procedures [for 1.5-month turnaround]

* A rolling deadline occurs on the 1st of each month at 9:00 AM (UTC-7). This deadline is strict and no extensions will be granted.
   * The submission server will open starting on the 20th of the preceding month.

* Month X, Day 2: Each new paper will be automatically assigned to 1 Associate Chair and 3 PC members.
   * Every effort will be made to assign Revised papers to the same Associate Chair and PC members.
   * PC members constitute a general pool (i.e., not assigned to a particular Associate Chair), and hence may end up working with several different Associate Chairs.
   * Goal: Each PC member will receive 1-3 new papers every other month, and possibly revisions to previous papers each month.  
   * We expect a spike (perhaps 3-5 papers per PC member) in the last two months before the conference cutoff.

* By Month X, Day 3: Associate Chairs review assignments and reassign based on preferences/expertise.  Email assignments to PC members.

* By Month X, Day 5: Cutoff for papers to be Withdrawn without penalty.  After this point, a Withdrawn paper is subject to a 12-month moratorium from the date of submission.
   * This moratorium (as well as all others mentioned in this document) only applies to submission to IEEE S&P.  Authors are free to resubmit elsewhere or to post their publications online.

* Month X+1, Day 1: Initial reviews due.  Discussion period begin.
   * For each paper, 3-5 PC members who did not review the paper will be assigned to sanity-check the reviews and participate in the discussion.
   * PC members will be able to see all reviews for all papers they are not conflicted with, and PC members will be encouraged to participate in the discussion of all such papers. 
      * Chairs/Associate Chairs will disseminate a list (appropriately redacted for conflicts) of papers likely to be accepted to encourage further discussion.
   * Chairs and Associate Chairs may solicit additional reviews.

* Month X+1, Day 15: Decision reached.  Associate Chair responsible for driving discussions to a conclusion.  
   * A decision is one of: Reject, Revise, or Accept.
      * Associate Chairs make a recommendation to the Chairs, who make the final decision.
   * Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P.
      * The policy on what distinguishes a new submission from a resubmission will need to be tuned over time.  If a paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission, then the paper will be considered a resubmission and subject to the one-year moratorium.
   * Accepted papers will be expected to submit a camera-ready copy by the end of Month X+1 to be published online.  Late submissions will be published as part of the Month X+2 batch.
      * Submission should include delta from submission
      * Associate Chair reviews to ensures comments addressed and only appropriate new material added
      * Once approved, camera-ready papers are published online at the end of the month.  
         * They may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 20XX”.
         * Ideally, they will be published via the usual IEEE channels.
         * Failing that, they can be published on the Symposium’s website as preprints until the conference.
         * Failing that, they can be published on Archive and linked to from the Symposium’s website.
   * Papers that receive a Revise response will also receive a review summary from the Associate Chair stating what revisions are necessary to reach acceptance.
      * Revisions must be submitted to one of the next 3 submission deadlines.  After that they will be treated as Withdrawn and subject to the same 12-month moratorium as Rejected papers.
      * It will be emphasized to reviewers that a good paper that only needs minor revisions should be Accepted, not Revised.  Conversely, only papers that the reviewers truly believe will be IEEE S&P quality following a revision should be marked Revise.  All others should be Rejected.
      * Associate Chairs and PC members will remain anonymous throughout this process, unless they choose to deanonymize themselves.
   * For new papers, based on the experience of other communities, such as VLDB, our expectation is that:
      * 1-5% of papers will be Accepted
      * 10-14% of papers will be Revised.
      * 80-85% of papers will be Rejected
      * Overall, the goal is to maintain or raise the current quality bar, rather than necessarily meeting a particular acceptance ratio.
   * For revised papers, the expectation is that:
      * The vast majority (over 80%) will be Accepted.
        * Follow the same camera-ready procedure as above
      * A small number will be Rejected.  Such papers will be subject to the standard 12-month moratorium, starting from the submission of the Revision.
      * Further revisions are only expected in extreme cases.

* Initial reviews will be returned to the authors by Month X+1, Day 15.

* Symposium Acceptance:
   * All papers Accepted (not submitted) by February 15th, 20XX will be invited to appear at the 20XX IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy.  Papers accepted subsequently will appear at the 20[XX+1] symposium.

* PC members will serve for one year, starting March 1st.  After the year completes, they will no longer receive new papers, but they will still be asked to review revisions to papers they previously reviewed.  By definition, this will continue for no more than 3 months (i.e., until after the May submission deadline).  
   * Associate Chairs will be handled similarly: After one year of service, their only obligation for the following three months will be to conclude decisions on revised papers.
   * We  will also continue the standard practice of ensuring reasonable overlap between consecutive PCs in order to ensure consistency

* PC Meeting
  * A PC meeting serves multiple useful functions that the community is reluctant to abandon entirely.  Hence, we will still have a PC meeting, likely in conjunction with the main conference or a related conference (e.g., NDSS), where the focus will be on assessing the accepted papers.  For example, the meeting may be used to decide on Distinguished-Paper awards and a larger pool of Honorable Mentions.
