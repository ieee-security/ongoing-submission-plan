# Transition to the New Submission Process

For the 2017 Symposium, we will follow the standard review process with the following revisions. 
* As usual, submissions will be due in early November, and authors will be notified of the paper decisions in early February.

* Papers rejected from the 2017 Symposium whose reviews clearly describe potential revisions that would have made the paper acceptable to the reviewers are encouraged to submit revised versions to the new review process when it begins.  Every effort will be made to assign these papers to the original PC members.
  * If the paper is then Accepted, it will proceed to a camera-ready iteration which will then be immediately published online and will be included in the 2018 Symposium.

* The “steady state” submission process for new papers will begin July 1st.  This will mean a shorter than average period of service for the PC members, since their “term” will end in March 2018.
