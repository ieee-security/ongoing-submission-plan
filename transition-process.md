# Transition to the New Submission Process

For the 2017 Symposium, we will follow the standard review process with the following revisions. 
* As usual, submissions will be due in early November, and authors will be notified of the paper decisions in early February.

* New: In addition to the usual Accept, Reject, or Accept with Shepherding decisions, some papers (we expect a fairly small number), will be marked for Revision.
   * Authors of such papers may choose to Withdraw their paper within one month at no penalty.  
   * If not Withdrawn, authors are expected to submit a revised version of the paper by June 1st.  Every effort will be made to assign these papers to the original PC members, which means those PC members will take on additional duties beyond the standard Oakland PC expectations.
      * If the paper is then Accepted, it will proceed to a camera-ready iteration which will then be immediately published online and will be included in the 2018 Symposium.

* The “steady state” submission process for new papers will begin June 1st.  This will mean a shorter than average period of service for the PC members, since their “term” will end in March 2018.
